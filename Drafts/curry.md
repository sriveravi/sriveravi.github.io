# Goat Curry

I used to get it from Indian Palace until they shut it down with no explanation. I made the 25 minute treck to find the building locked with the lights off and nothing inside. I felt sad and empty like so many buffet plates.  I just thought Mr. Singh and his little shop would stick around.  I stood there on the sidewalk of that strip mall and thought about the time I came in with a cast on my hand, and Mr. Singh told me to what oils and spices to rub on it. I never tried the spice rub, but I am pretty sure it would have helped (or been really tasty on some chicken). A new place opened up in the same location - a kind of mix between restaurant and clothing store.  I went once and never went back because the goat curry wasn't the same.

People don't get what 
Something about the spices at the old man's curry shop.
