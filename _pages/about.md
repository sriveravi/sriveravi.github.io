## Education

- **PhD in Electrical Engineering**  
I specialized in pattern recognition and statistical learning. I did quite a bit of work deriving and implementing algorithms for detailed deformable shape detection and object recognition. I also collaborated with some cognitive scientists and started learning about category learning.

- **Postdoctoral Researcher**  
I took those collaborations to the next level and did a few years in the cognitive development lab.
