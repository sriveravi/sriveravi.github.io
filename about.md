I am a postdoctoral researcher at The Ohio State University.  My graduate training was in Electrical Engineering.  Now I study cognitive development in the Cognitive Development Lab.  Reach me at [rivera.162@osu.edu](mailto:rivera.162@osu.edu).

### Research Interests

My current research is focused on conceptual development.  Through developmental studies and computational modeling, my research tries to uncover the mechanisms underlying our ability to learn and use concepts and categories.
