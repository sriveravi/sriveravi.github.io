I am a postdoctoral researcher at The Ohio State University.  My graduate training was in Electrical Engineering.  Now I study cognitive development in the Cognitive Development Lab at OSU.  

### Research Interests

I am interested in how people learn categories and concepts, and the mechanisms underlying developmental change.
