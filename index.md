title: About
---

I am Samuel Rivera, a research engineer and scientist.  My graduate training was in machine learning and pattern recognition.  My postdoctoral training was in cognitive development.  Through developmental studies and computational modeling, I worked to uncover the mechanisms underlying our ability to learn and use concepts and categories. Now I focus on machine learning and algorithm development.  Reach out for consulting.
